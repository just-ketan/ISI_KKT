68 balls: 34 pairs.

For each pair:

Compare the two: 1.

Compare heavier with heaviest: 1.

Compare lighter with lightest: 1.

Initially, heaviest and lightest can be the first pair's heavy and light.

Then, for next 33 pairs: 3 comparisons each: 99.

Total: 1 (first pair) + 99 = 100.

Here's how:

Compare B1 and B2:

Suppose B1 > B2: heaviest = B1, lightest = B2. (1 comparison)

For pairs (B3,B4) to (B67,B68): 33 pairs.

For each:

Compare the two: e.g., B3 vs B4. Suppose B3 > B4.

Compare B3 with heaviest: if B3 > heaviest, update. (1)

Compare B4 with lightest: if B4 < lightest, update. (1)

Total per pair: 3.

33 pairs: 99.

Total comparisons: 1 (initial) + 99 = 100.
