Consider a reservoir, fitted with a set of taps and drains. The partial pseudocode
given below takes as input:
L capacity of the reservoir in litres
T number of taps attached to the reservoir
D number of drains attached to the reservoir
ti time in minutes that it takes to fill an initially empty reservoir if all drains
are stopped, and only the i-th tap is opened (1 ≤ i ≤ T)
dj time in minutes that it takes to drain an initially full
reservoir if all taps are shut off, and only the j-th drain is opened
(1 ≤ j ≤ D)
Fill in the blanks below, so that the statements printed by the pseudocode are
correct. Do not copy the pseudocode; simply write the serial number of each blank
(I, II, . . ., VI), and your corresponding answer.
Pseudocode:
Initially, set variables X and Y to 0.
for i in {1, 2, 3, . . . , T} X ←− X+ (I) .
for j in {1, 2, 3, . . . , D} Y ←− Y + (II) .
If X (III) Y
then print “A partially empty reservoir never fills up if all taps and drains are
kept open.”
else print “An initially empty reservoir fills up in (IV) minutes if all taps
and drains are kept open.”
If X (V) Y
then print “A partially full reservoir never becomes empty if all taps and drains
are kept open.”
else print “An initially full reservoir becomes empty in (VI) minutes if all
taps and drains are kept open.”
